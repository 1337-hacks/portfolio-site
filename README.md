Elijah's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site. Check here for updates...

To-do (in chronological order):
- Add animations + transitions to pages
- Add Projects page
- Add Contacts page
- Make links to socials work
- Three scene to build and refine
- Homepage responsiveness to refine
- Responsiveness on all other pages

Development Notes:
- To remove react-bootstrap library (not suitable for this kind of site)
- To implement css flexbox layout instead of bootstrap layout
- Add animations after completing a single page!
- Have to design a 404 redirect page...
- Development is going well and hopefully will be able to have a complete and working site very soon :)
