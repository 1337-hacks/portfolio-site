## Elijah's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site! Check here for updates...

Site has not launched yet! However development is going at a good pace and I will hopefully launch very soon üôè

This site is created using the following:
- React
- Threejs
- React Three Fiber
- React-Spring (may remove)
- React-Router
- React-Transition-Group

**2/02/23 -** Currently the site is not fully optimised for tablet and mobile sizes which will be worked on soon.

#### To-do (in chronological order):
- ~~projects section animations (using react-spring)~~
- ~~footer styling (buttons)~~
- ~~create about page~~
- page transitions
- refine projects page


#### Development Notes:
- To design tablet and mobile (and maybe ultrawide) versions after PC version is fully working
- Have to design a 404 redirect page
