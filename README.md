Welcome to my portfolio site! Check here for updates...

#### This site is created using the following:
- React
- Threejs
- React Three Fiber
- React-Router
- Framer-Motion

### To-do (in chronological order):
- Design and implement ultrawide support
- Improve tablet + mobile version
- Design and implement a 404 redirect page
- Improve accessibility features of site

### Development Notes
- 9/02/23: The performance of the site can be improved, but this will be implemented at a later date.
- 9/02/23: Currently the site does not have any accessibility features. This will be added in the near future.
- 5/02/23: Removed react-spring as it was not fully utilised and plain CSS achieved what was required.
- 5/02/23: The current "projects" page design is not final. This will be redesigned when more projects are added.
