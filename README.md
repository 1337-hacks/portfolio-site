## Elijah's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site! Check here for updates...

Site has been launched! üôè See the live site here: https://elijahnucum.netlify.app/

#### This site is created using the following:
- React
- Threejs
- React Three Fiber
- React-Router
- Framer-Motion

**IMPORTANT NOTE (5/02/23) -** As of now the site is not fully optimised for tablet and mobile sizes, ~~which will be worked on soon~~ but is currently being worked on!

### To-do (in chronological order):
- Optimise performance of spinning globe (Threejs)
- Design and implement tablet and mobile (and maybe ultrawide) versions after PC version is fully functional
- Design and implement a 404 redirect page

### Development Notes
- 5/02/23: Removed react-spring as it was not fully utilised and plain CSS achieved what was required.
- 5/02/23: The current projects page design is not final. This will be redesigned when more projects are added.
